These chunks are not cut up exactly where the words start or end - they can include trailing spaces and even sub-words. On average 1 token ~= 4 chars in English or ~= Â¾ words.',

    title: 'How are tokens calculated?',
    content:
      'Tokens are calculated by the total number of chunks in the prompt and in the response. If a request is made with a prompt of 100 tokens and a response of 100 tokens, the total tokens used will be 200. Keep in mind requests regarding websites are pre-prompted with webpage data. All webpage data is refactored and minified to ensure the minimum amount of tokens are used whilst still providing the AI with the context it needs. The amount of tokens the webpage data will cost is highly variable depending on the website. A website with little content like www.google.com will only be around 100 tokens whilst a website with lots of content like a social media feed can be more than 2000 tokens. A simple way to check is to take note of your token count in your usage before and after a request. Generated prompts will also factor into your usage. See the "What are generated prompts?" section for more information. For more information you can check how many tokens are in a prompt using Open AI tokenizer: https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer.',
